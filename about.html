								<br>
								My name is Jackson Riley Daugherty, and I was born on May 1st, 2002. I have lived in Florence my entire life. I am an only-child and I have six cats!
								
								
								<img class="test_image" src="images/me.jpg" alt="Placeholder" width="125px">
								
								<br><br>
								I attended West Florence High School and graduated in 2020. Since then I briefly attended Francis Marion University before ultimately deciding to come to Florence-Darlington.
								<br><br>In fact, I had actually been taking a break from education for a few years before making this decision, but now that I am here I feel much more confident and fulfilled than I ever have been before about school.
								<br><br>
								I have been employed at McLeod Regional Medical Center here in Florence as a patient transporter for about four years now, but I have never wanted to pursue a serious career in the medical field.
								I have always had a passion for all-things programming and I believe I would best excel in this career path.
								<br><br>

							<div class="div_topbar">Hobbies</div>
							<p>
								<br>
								I have always loved computers. I began to dabble in programming when I was about 9 or 10 with <i>Roblox</i>, 
								a multiplayer game where you can create entire games within its engine that can be programmed using Lua as a scripting language.
								
								
								
								<br><br> <img class="logo_image" src="images/old_roblox_logo.png" alt="Placeholder" width="150px">
								Of course, then, it goes without saying that I also like video games. 
								In fact, I still try to make things with Roblox from time to time, although partly because of the amount of time I've invested into it!<br><br>
								That being said, though, I do not consider my dream job being a video game developer.<br>
								If I ever did, I think it would be as an independent, something which nowadays is a much more feasible career path than it might have been several years ago.
								One of my favorite games, <i>Undertale</i>, was programmed solely by one person in his spare time and later went on to be a massive success, even spawning a sequel.
								<br><br>
								Other than that, another one of my favorite hobbies is biking. I get a lot of my exercise from my job, but when the weather is nice I love to ride around and feel the wind in my hair.<br>

							<div class="div_topbar">Experience</div>
							<p>
							
								<br>
								I have varying levels of experience in several programming languages. My strongest would probably be Lua, then followed by C.
								I also have some knowledge in C++, C#, Java, and a small bit of Python.<br><br>
								You can find out more about my experience on the <a href="skills.html">Skills</a> page.
								<br><br>

						</div>
						
						<div class="div_container">
							<div class="div_topbar">Goals</div>
							<p>
								<br>
								As mentioned before, my main goal is to find a career in programming, or at least computing in some higher capacity.
								What exactly that might be I am not certain yet, although once I complete this web design course a huge door will open for me, naturally.
								<br>
								I always love to learn more about computing so I doubt this will be the last time I am in school. That is, I might pursue higher education
								at a later time if I think it is necessary.
